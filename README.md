# TaskImGui

The program presents 2 windows with testing the work of ImGui on opengl3 glfw (well, my knowledge :D), namely: writing text, text output and built-in tools for drawing shapes. 
The stbi_image library and working with textures from opengl3 were used for the image.

Cmake is used to build on ninja and g++. Accordingly, all this needs to be downloaded.
To build, go to build and run cmake build ../src in the terminal, then run ninja in build to build.

You also need to download opengl3 and glfw, otherwise nothing will work :'(

If nothing starts for you, it's not my fault, it's retrograde mercury >///<
