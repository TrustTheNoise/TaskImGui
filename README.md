# TaskImGui

The program presents 2 windows with testing the work of ImGui on opengl3 glfw (and of course my knowledge :D), namely: writing text, text output and built-in tools for drawing shapes. 
The stbi_image library and working with textures from opengl3 were used for the image.

Cmake is used to build on ninja and g++. Accordingly, all this needs to be downloaded.
WINDOWS:To build, go to /build and run `cmake ../src` in the terminal, then run `ninja` in build to build.
LINUX: Make your own build directory to `cmake` ))

You also need to download opengl3, otherwise nothing will work :'(

If nothing starts for you, it's not my fault, it's retrograde mercury >///<
